# Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice implemented
in **Java**, focused on building strong problem-solving fundamentals for
technical interviews.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- HashMaps
- Recursion
- Searching & Sorting
- Two Pointers

## Purpose
- Strengthen core DSA concepts
- Prepare for coding interviews (service-based and product-based companies)
- Improve time and space complexity analysis

Each solution includes:
- Clear implementation
- Readable code structure
- Time and space complexity comments
